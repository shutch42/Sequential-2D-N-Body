# Sequential-2D-N-Body
This is a test of N-Body simulation using C++. It's not the most efficient solution, but it works as a proof of concept. The real goal with this repo is to learn to program graphics in C++. I did this using the freeglut library, which uses OpenGL. The results look good, but it starts crashing at around 800 masses. This is still a massive improvement from the python N-Body solution, because it runs in real-time, and does not require loading time to build the simulation. The next implementation of this project will be a Barnes-Hut solution.
